## What is laeto.li?
laeto.li is a habit tracking service to keep track of the movies and tv
shows you have been watching - like a diary, or more like the history of
your footprints.

## Who is behind it?
I'm Onur Yasar, a full stack web developer based in London. This is a
personal side project for me to practice my coding, specifically
Javascript, skills. I'm passionate about keeping track of my watching
activity, been using services like Letterboxd and Trakt.tv for years. So
wanted to build one for my own :)
